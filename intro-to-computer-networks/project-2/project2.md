### Q2

UDP

### Q3

20 in the header
34 in the payload, everything after the ip header is the payload

### Q4 

no, the more fragments flag is 0 and the fragment offset is 0

### Q5

Identification and Header Checksum

### Q6

all other fields besides Identification and Header Checksum stay the same, except for Time to Live increases every few packets
most of the fields are related to the protocol being used and they must stay constant otherwise the protocol would change, identification must change because each packet must have a unique ID and checksum changes whenever anything in the packet changes

### Q7

it appears to be semi random, but avoids repetition

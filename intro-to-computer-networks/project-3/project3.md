### (a)

the routers need routing table entries for the other subnets

## 4

### (a)
both PDUs were successful and routed directly to and from laptop 0

### (b)

# Transport layer concepts

## 1

4: source port, destination port, length, checksum

## 2

they are each wto bytes long

## 3

the length of the whole UDP datagram. including header

## 4

65507

## 5

65535

## 6

hex: 11
dec: 17

## 7

the source and destinations of the two packets flip

# Open Ended Questions

UDP: short header, simple, no sequencing/ACK

TCP: longer header, more complex, includes ordering/ACK

QUIC: long header, has TCP like qualities, implimented over UDP
